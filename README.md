The VBA script that I expoerted from Microsoft Excel Macros.
It works in the following manner:
 - Loops through all the worksheets in the Workbook (excel file)
 - For each work sheet
     - Loops through all the rows to find when a ticker symbol changes
     - Keeps track of all opening and closing prices
     - Calculates quarterly change for the opening price at the beginning and the closing price at the end when a ticker symbol changes.
